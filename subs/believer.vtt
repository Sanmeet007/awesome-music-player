1
00:00:07.612 --> 00:00:08.977
First things first

2
00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:11.750
I am gona say all the words
inside my head

3
00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:15.739
I am fired up and tired of the
way that things have been

4
00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:19.632
The way that things have been

5
00:00:22.716 --> 00:00:24.315
Second things second

6
00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.282
Don′t you tell me what you
think that I could be

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.199
I am the one at the sail‚ I
am the master of my sea

8
00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:34.916
The master of my sea

9
00:00:37.878 --> 00:00:39.745
I was broken from a young age

10
00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:41.608
Taken my sulking to the masses

11
00:00:41.652 --> 00:00:43.519
Writing my poems for the few

12
00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:45.334
That look to me‚ took to me‚
shook to me‚ feeling me

13
00:00:45.368 --> 00:00:47.401
Singing from heartache from the pain

14
00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:49.306
Taking my message from the veins

15
00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:51.235
Speaking my lesson from the brain

16
00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:52.774
Seeing the beauty through the

17
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.803
Pain

18
00:00:55.835 --> 00:01:00.468
You made me a‚ you made me
a believer‚ believer

19
00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:03.745
Pain

20
00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:07.984
You break me down‚ you build
me up believer‚ believer

21
00:01:08.982 --> 00:01:10.781
Pain

22
00:01:10.817 --> 00:01:14.550
Let the bullets fly oh let them rain

23
00:01:14.584 --> 00:01:16.817
My life‚ my love‚ my drive‚
it came from

24
00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:18.842
Pain

25
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:24.365
You made me a‚ you made me
a believer‚ believer

26
00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.650
Third things third

27
00:01:25.674 --> 00:01:28.607
Send a prayer to the ones up above

28
00:01:28.647 --> 00:01:32.480
All the hate that You have heard has
turned your spirit to a dove

29
00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:34.581
Oh oo

30
00:01:34.607 --> 00:01:36.340
Your spirit up above

31
00:01:36.368 --> 00:01:38.635
Oh oo

32
00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:40.946
I was choking in the crowd

33
00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:42.951
Building my rain up in the cloud

34
00:01:42.973 --> 00:01:44.840
Falling like ashes to the ground

35
00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:46.809
Hoping my feelings‚ they would drown

36
00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:48.948
But they never did‚ ever lived‚
ebbing and flowing

37
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.947
Inhibited‚ limited‚ till it broke open

38
00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:54.984
And rained down‚ you rained down like

39
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.273
Pain

40
00:01:57.305 --> 00:02:01.870
You made me a‚ you made me
a believer‚ believer

41
00:02:03.672 --> 00:02:05.271

You break me down you build
me up believer‚ believer

43
00:02:10.336 --> 00:02:12.235
Pain

44
00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:15.810
Let the bullets fly‚ oh let them rain

45
00:02:15.838 --> 00:02:18.937
My life‚ my love‚ my drive‚
it came from

46
00:02:18.973 --> 00:02:20.406
Pain

47

By the grace of the fire and the flame

50
00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.264
You are the face of the future

51
00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.883
The blood in my veins

52
00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.668
The blood in my veins

53
00:02:40.634 --> 00:02:42.733
But they never did‚ ever lived‚
ebbing and flowing

54
00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.602
Inhibited‚ limited‚ till it broke open

And rained down‚ you rained down like

56
00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:54.612
I want to stop

57
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.533
We can′t

58
00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:00.882
