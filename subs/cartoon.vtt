1
00:00:11.208 --> 00:00:13.707
Hold me close ′til I get up

2
00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:17.798
Time is barely on our side

3
00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:21.917
I don′t want to waste what′s left

4
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:24.600
The storms we chase are leading us

5
00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:28.701
And love is all we′ll ever trust yeah

6
00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.708
No I don′t want to waste what′s left

7
00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:38.207
And on and on we′ll go

8
00:00:38.407 --> 00:00:41.006
Through the wastelands
through the highways

9
00:00:41.216 --> 00:00:43.715
To my shadow to the sunrays

10
00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:49.310
And on and on we′ll go

11
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.009
Through the wastelands
through the highways

12
00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:00.218
And on and on we′ll go

13
00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:25.405
Finding life along the way

14
00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:29.210
Melodies we hadn′t played

15
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.309
No I don′t want no rest

16
00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.398
Echoing around these walls

17
00:01:36.606 --> 00:01:40.605
Fighting to create a song

18
00:01:40.811 --> 00:01:44.510
I don′t want to miss a beat

19
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.899
And on and on we′ll go

20
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:52.600
Through the wastelands
through the highways

21
00:01:52.802 --> 00:01:55.401
To my shadow to the sun rays

22
00:01:55.617 --> 00:02:00.916
And on and on we′ll go

23
00:02:01.104 --> 00:02:03.903
Through the wastelands
through the highways

24
00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:12.108
And on and on we′ll go

25
00:02:28.604 --> 00:02:31.603
And we′ll grow in number

26
00:02:31.815 --> 00:02:36.214
Fueled by thunder‚ see the horizon

27
00:02:36.412 --> 00:02:39.411
Turn us into thousands

28
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:42.600
And we′ll grow in number

29
00:02:42.802 --> 00:02:47.101
Fueled by thunder‚ see the horizon

30
00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.918
Turn us into thousands

31
00:02:51.116 --> 00:02:56.215
And on and on we′ll go

32
00:02:56.415 --> 00:02:58.814
Through the wastelands
through the highways

33
00:02:59.016 --> 00:03:01.615
To my shadow to the sunrays

34
00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:07.114
And on and on we′ll go

35
00:03:07.318 --> 00:03:10.017
Through the wastelands
through the highways

36
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:15.210
And on and on we′ll go

37
00:03:16.214 --> 00:03:25.213
