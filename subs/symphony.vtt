00:00:39.717 --> 00:00:42.516
I have been hearing symphonies

2
00:00:43.512 --> 00:00:46.811
Before all I heard was silence

3
00:00:47.215 --> 00:00:50.214
A rhapsody for you and me

4
00:00:51.204 --> 00:00:54.703
And every melody is timeless

5
00:00:55.315 --> 00:00:58.514
Life was stringing me along

6
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.609
Then you came and you cut me loose

7
00:01:02.913 --> 00:01:06.112
Was solo singing on my own

8
00:01:06.818 --> 00:01:09.667
Now I can′t find the key without you

9
00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.218
And now your song is on repeat

10
00:01:13.304 --> 00:01:17.403
And I am dancin′ on to your heartbeat

11
00:01:17.513 --> 00:01:20.912
And when You are gone‚
I feel incomplete

12
00:01:21.012 --> 00:01:24.311
So if you want the truth

13
00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:28.914
I just wanna be part of your symphony

14
00:01:30.218 --> 00:01:33.617
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

15
00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:37.914
Symphony

16
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.399
Like a love song on the radio

17
00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:45.200
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

18
00:01:45.816 --> 00:01:48.615
I am sorry if It is all too much

19
00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.808
Every day You are here‚ I am healing

20
00:01:53.702 --> 00:01:56.401
And I was runnin′ out of luck

21
00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:00.610
I never thought I had
find this feeling

22
00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:04.603
′Cause I have been hearing symphonies

23
00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:08.700
Before all I heard was silence

24
00:02:09.318 --> 00:02:11.567
A rhapsody for you and me

25
00:02:11.613 --> 00:02:13.112
(A rhapsody for you and me)

26
00:02:13.114 --> 00:02:15.913
And every melody is timeless

27
