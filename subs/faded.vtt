1
00:00:11.652 --> 00:00:14.551
You were the shadow to my light

2
00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:18.166
Did you feel us?

3
00:00:18.364 --> 00:00:20.163
Another start

4
00:00:20.365 --> 00:00:21.864
You fade away

5
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.159
Afraid our aim is out of sight

6
00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:28.752
Wanna see us

7
00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:31.267
Alive

8
00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:36.758
Where are you now?

9
00:00:36.952 --> 00:00:42.051
Where are you now?

10
00:00:42.253 --> 00:00:44.552
Where are you now?

11
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.459
Was it all in my fantasy?

12
00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:50.168
Where are you now?

13
00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:54.061
Were you only imaginary?

14
00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.368
Where are you now?

15
00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:59.457
Atlantis

16
00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:01.854
Under the sea

17
00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.961
Under the sea

18
00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.358
Where are you now?

19
00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:10.667
Another dream

20
00:01:10.853 --> 00:01:14.952
The monster′s running
wild inside of me

21
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.159
I am faded

22
00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:23.950
I am faded

23
00:01:24.152 --> 00:01:30.751
So lost‚ I am faded

24
00:01:30.953 --> 00:01:34.652
I am faded

25
00:01:34.854 --> 00:01:38.053
So lost‚ I am faded

26
00:01:38.253 --> 00:01:44.752
These shallow waters never
met what I needed

27
00:01:44.962 --> 00:01:48.661
I am letting go a deeper dive

28
00:01:48.865 --> 00:01:56.864
Eternal silence of the sea.
I am breathing alive

29
00:01:58.154 --> 00:02:03.353
Where are you now?

30
00:02:03.555 --> 00:02:08.654
Where are you now?

31
00:02:08.868 --> 00:02:11.367
Under the bright but faded lights

32
00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:13.958
You have set my heart on fire

33
00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.765
Where are you now?

34
00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:24.958
Where are you now?

35
00:02:31.654 --> 00:02:34.653
Where are you now?

36
00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:36.766
Atlantis

37
00:02:36.968 --> 00:02:39.467
Under the sea

38
00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.168
Under the sea

39
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.659
Where are you now?

40
00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.958
Another dream

41
00:02:48.154 --> 00:02:52.053
The monster′s running
wild inside of me

42
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:57.460
I am faded

43
00:02:57.656 --> 00:03:01.255
I am faded

44
00:03:01.461 --> 00:03:08.060
So lost‚ I am faded

45
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.949
I am faded

46
00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:17.168
So lost‚ I am faded

47
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:27.149
