1
00:00:14.707 --> 00:00:18.206
I am always ready for a war again

2
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:20.501
Go down that road again

3
00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:22.714
It is all the same

4
00:00:24.418 --> 00:00:28.017
I am always ready to take a life again

5
00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:30.210
You know I will ride again

6
00:00:30.912 --> 00:00:33.211
It is all the same

7
00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:37.810
Tell me who′s gon′ save me from myself

8
00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:42.515
When this life is all I know

9
00:00:42.907 --> 00:00:47.206
Tell me who′s gon′ save
me from this hell

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.799
Without you‚ I am all alone

11
00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:54.016
Who gon′ pray for me?

12
00:00:54.816 --> 00:00:57.015
Take my pain for me?

13
00:00:57.105 --> 00:00:59.304
Save my soul for me?

14
00:00:59.408 --> 00:01:01.807
′Cause I am alone‚ you see

15
00:01:01.903 --> 00:01:04.102
If I am gon′ die for you

16
00:01:04.204 --> 00:01:06.503
If I am gon′ kill for you

17
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:11.300
Then I will spill this
blood for you‚ hey

18
00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.605
I fight the world‚ I fight
you‚ I fight myself

19
00:01:14.703 --> 00:01:16.902
I fight God‚ just tell me
how many burdens left

20
00:01:17.018 --> 00:01:19.217
I fight pain and hurricanes‚
today I wept

21
00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:21.804
I am tryna fight back tears‚
flood on my doorsteps

22
00:01:21.908 --> 00:01:24.107
Life a livin′ hell‚ puddles
of blood in the streets

23
00:01:24.213 --> 00:01:26.712
Shooters on top of the building‚
government aid ain′t relief

24
00:01:26.802 --> 00:01:28.801
Earthquake‚ the body drop‚
the ground breaks

25
00:01:28.907 --> 00:01:31.206
The poor run with smoke
lungs and Scarface

26
00:01:31.304 --> 00:01:33.003
Who need a hero? (Hero)

27
00:01:33.107 --> 00:01:35.206
You need a hero‚ look in the
mirror‚ there go your hero

28
00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:37.603
Who on the front lines at
ground zero? (Hero)

29
00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:40.314
My heart don′t skip a beat‚ even when
hard times bumps the needle

30
00:01:40.404 --> 00:01:42.203
Mass destruction and mass corruption

31
00:01:42.313 --> 00:01:43.612
The souls of sufferin′ men

32
00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:45.911
Clutchin′ on deaf ears again‚
rapture is comin′

33
00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:49.114
It is all prophecy and if I gotta be
sacrificed for the greater good

34
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.709
Then that′s what it gotta be

35
00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:51.910
Who gon′ pray for me?

36
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.199
Take my pain for me?

37
00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:56.616
Save my soul for me?

38
00:01:56.718 --> 00:01:59.017
′Cause I am alone‚ you see

39
00:01:59.113 --> 00:02:01.412
If I am gon′ die for you

40
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.799

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:11.911
Hey‚ hey‚ hey‚ hey

Then I will spill this
blood for you‚ hey

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:52.907
Just in case my faith go‚

00:02:53.017 --> 00:02:57.116
I live by my own law‚ I live by my own

54
00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:02.507
Just in case my faith go‚
I live by my own law

55
00:03:02.613 --> 00:03:07.812
I live by my own law‚ I live by my own

56
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:17.799
